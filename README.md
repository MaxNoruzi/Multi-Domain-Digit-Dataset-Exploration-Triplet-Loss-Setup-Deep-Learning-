# 🔍 Multi-Domain Digit Dataset Exploration & Triplet Loss Setup (Deep Learning)

This project focuses on loading, visualizing, and preparing a **multi-domain digit dataset** for deep learning tasks. It also includes a **custom Triplet Loss** implementation — a critical component in metric learning used for training embedding-based models.
